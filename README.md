# simpleEQ

This a plugin I built to familiarize myself with the JUCE framework. It is simple, 3-band EQ plugin with low-cut,
high-cut, and peak filter options. The slope of the high/low cut bands are adjustable, as well as the quality (Q)
of the peak band.
There is  no GUI yet, but I plan on adding one soon.

I followed a tutorial on YouTube created by MatKatMusic for freeCodeCamp:
